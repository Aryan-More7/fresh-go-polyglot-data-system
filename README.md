# fresh-go-polyglot-data-system
This project implements a polyglot persistence system for Fresh Go, an online grocery business struggling with operational inefficiencies such as:
	•	Stockouts and excess inventory
	•	Poor delivery performance
	•	Inability to identify high-value customers
	•	No system for analysing customer feedback
	•	Disorganised data infrastructure

To address this, the system integrates:
	•	SQL Server for structured operational data
	•	MongoDB for unstructured customer feedback
	•	Python for data ingestion, integration, and analytics

This repository includes the full SQL schema, Python notebook for data operations, and analytical outputs.
